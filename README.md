### Obullo Php Framework

Small, fast & expandable.

* Small because of it has 8 core components.
* Easy to run your application from dev.app.php in 5 steps.
* Supports Http Middlewares, Ps6 and Psr7 Standarts, Dependency Injection, Service Providers.
* Bundle creation. ( A Bundle is a directory containing a set of files ( Controllers, Routes, Middlewares, Console Commands, Services Providers, Templates, Data, â€¦) that implement a single feature (a blog, a forum, etc).
* The core natively supports HMVC design pattern.
* The router contains just 400 lines of code.
* Ready for php7.

### Philosophy

* The smaller parts that consist the whole framework should be compatible with each other.
